# gates/

Gate definitions, scanner pins and MIT rulesets (spec §4.4, §7). Owned by the gate-runner team
(AD-15). The Gate Runner itself lives in `packages/engine/src/gates/`.

- `scanners.json` (validated by `ScannerPinsSchema` in `@vtc/shared`): each scanner pinned by
  version, an https download URL template and a SHA-256 **per platform**, copied from the
  release's published checksums. The same pins are embedded in the binary
  (`packages/engine/src/gates/scanner-pins.ts`, which also maps each platform to the release's
  asset name); a test keeps the two equal. Scanners are downloaded on demand into
  `~/.vtc/scanners/<name>/<version>/<platform>/`, verified against the pin before anything is
  unpacked, and re-verified before every use. Never auto-updated (§7.2, §15).
  - Gitleaks 8.30.1 (MIT), osv-scanner 2.6.0 (Apache-2.0, always run with `--offline`),
    Opengrep 1.30.1 (LGPL-2.1, run as a separate program), Checkov 3.3.20 (Apache-2.0; no
    darwin-arm64 build is published, so on Apple silicon it must be installed by the user and
    confirmed in `vtc calibrate`).
  - diff-cover (L3) is a Python package with no per-platform binary, so it is not pinned here: a
    project that wants L3 installs it and confirms the command like any other.
- `rules/opengrep/` holds VTC's own Opengrep rules, licensed MIT. They are embedded too
  (`packages/engine/src/gates/rules.ts`, kept equal by a test), written to
  `~/.vtc/rules/<hash>/` on first use and passed to Opengrep through the `{rules}` placeholder.
- No CodeQL engine, no bundled Semgrep-maintained rules; GPL/AGPL tools only as separate
  user-installed programs (§7.2 licensing).
- Per-project calibrated gates and the baseline live in the target repo's `.vtc/gates.yml`
  (validated by `GatesConfigSchema`), written by `vtc calibrate`.

Gate command placeholders (whole argv tokens are never passed through a shell):
`{base}` / `{head}` (the commits of the run; a command using them is range-scoped and is not
compared with the base again), `{changed}` (the changed files that exist in the checkout, as
separate arguments; the gate is skipped when there are none) and `{rules}` (the product ruleset
directory). Report paths are relative to the gate's working directory and should point under
`.vtc/state/`.
